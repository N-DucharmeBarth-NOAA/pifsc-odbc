Parallel download tools for Oracle databases at PIFSC. The package provides efficient multi-core data extraction from fisheries logbook datasets with automatic credential management, year-based partitioning, and progress tracking.

## Key Features

- **Secure credential storage** using the system keyring
- **Parallel downloads** with automatic year-based partitioning
- **Flexible workflows** for single tables or batch processing
- **Progress tracking** with performance metrics
- **Optimized for large datasets** common in fisheries research

## Prerequisites

1. **Oracle Instant Client 23.9+** with ODBC component installed
2. **PIFSC network** or **NOAA VPN** connection for database access

See `vignette("connections")` for detailed setup instructions.

## Installation

```{r}
# install.packages("renv")
renv::install("N-DucharmeBarth-NOAA/pifsc-odbc")
```

## Quick Start

### One-time setup

Store your database credentials (only needed once per machine):

```{r}
library(pifsc.odbc)
setup_credentials()
```

### Download a single table

```{r}
# Parallel download with automatic year detection
hdr <- parallel_download(
  table = "LLDS_HDR_20240315HAC",
  year_col = "LANDYR"
)

# Download specific years
hdr_recent <- parallel_download(
  table = "LLDS_HDR_20240315HAC",
  year_col = "LANDYR",
  years = 2015:2023,
  n_cores = 4
)
```

### Download multiple tables

```{r}
tables <- list(
  list(table = "LLDS_HDR_20240315HAC", year_col = "LANDYR"),
  list(table = "LLDS_DETAIL_20240315HAC", year_col = "HDR_LANDYR")
)

# Download and save to CSV
results <- download_tables(tables, output_dir = "logbook-data")
```

### Simple single-threaded download

For small tables or when parallel connections aren't needed:

```{r}
ref <- simple_download(table = "LLDS_SOME_REF_TABLE")
```

- [Database Connections](https://n-ducharmebarth-noaa.github.io/pifsc-odbc/articles/connections.html) - Setup and connection management
- [Parallel Downloads](https://n-ducharmebarth-noaa.github.io/pifsc-odbc/articles/downloads.html) - Download strategies and performance tuning

## How It Works

The parallel download strategy:

1. Queries the database to find available years
2. Splits years evenly across worker cores
3. Each worker opens its own connection, downloads assigned years, and disconnects
4. Results are combined into a single `data.table`

This approach limits concurrent connections to the number of cores, making it database-friendly while achieving significant speedups for large tables.
